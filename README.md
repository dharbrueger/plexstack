# plexstack

## NOTICE
This repo is mainly going to be used to house and track changes to my docker-compose file for running some Plex related services on my home server, but also I'll be using it as a kind of catch all for ideas that I could personally implement to improve the stack and hopefully try out some fun new technology with it

## Background
My docker-compose file for a bunch of services I currently run on my Synology NAS.
This was something that was sort of haphazardly thrown together after my home server lost two of its disks after a reboot. 

I was running a similar stack on a R720xd rack server running Proxmox with a few different virtual machines running in the environment. 
That previous stack was being ran on a VM on whatever version of the Ubuntu Server LTS was current when I first stood up the server.

## Goals
 - Learn more about Docker
 - Refresh my networking skills (maybe revamp my home network setup as a side project)
 - Get to a point where this stack is stable on my Synology NAS
